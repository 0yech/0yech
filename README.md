## About me
I'm a 22 Years old IT specialist from Vaud, I've dealt with Servers, Support and now Code.
0yech's my Github name, but I usually go by Cheyo.

I currently am at 42 Lausanne. It's been great until now, you should try it out.

## Objectives

I look forward to trying out specific fields in the future, such as :
- 💾 Low level
- 💖 Rust 
- ⌨️ Game dev
- 🕹️ Game design
- Probably more to come

## Terrible Decision making
- I have a creative mind, so i threw away Frontend for Backend.
- Python and Django were hot, so i used Ruby on Rails.
- Created a variable called Strint in C, type's int, stores a string. I hope it becomes a standard one day.
- I really like Smash Brothers, so I became the best Brawlhalla player in my country.

## Experiences
- IT CFC at École des Arches
- IT Specialist at LAS
- Data Integration Specialist at LAS
- Volunteer, side projects and testing for Gameforge AG
