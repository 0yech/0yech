## Currently working on

Minishell with [Aisling Fontaine](https://github.com/FireInsidE-fie) (42 Rank03)

## Objectives

I look forward to trying out specific fields in the future, such as :
- 💾 Low level
- 💖 Rust 
- ⌨️ Game dev
- 🕹️ Game design
- Probably more to come

## Terrible Decision making/Banger trackrecord
- I have a creative mind, so i threw away Frontend for Backend.
- Python and Django were hot, so i used Ruby on Rails.
- I can use SQL server management studio 2019, but only in chinese.
- Created a variable called Strint in C, type's int, stores a string. I hope it becomes a standard one day.
- I really like Smash Brothers, so I became the best Brawlhalla player in my country.

## Experiences
- IT CFC at École des Arches
- IT Specialist at LAS
- Data Integration Specialist at LAS
- Volunteering, testing and side dev projects for Gameforge AG
